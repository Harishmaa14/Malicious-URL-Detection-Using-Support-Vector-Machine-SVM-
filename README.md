# Malicious-URL-Detection-Using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based prediction model to detect malicious URLs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled URLs classified as either benign or malicious. By extracting meaningful features from the URL strings—such as length, special characters, presence of suspicious keywords, and domain information—the SVM learns to differentiate harmful URLs from safe ones. SVM’s effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and finding optimal separating hyperplanes makes it well-suited for this binary classification task. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable detection of phishing, malware, and other harmful web addresses. This solution helps enhance cybersecurity measures by providing an automated, efficient method to filter malicious URLs and protect users.
